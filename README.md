# WellCare - Hospital Management System

> Hospitals today face increasing challenges in managing their operations efficiently due to growing
patient demands, fragmented workflows, and reliance on manual processes. Issues such as inefficient
appointment scheduling, lack of centralized medical records, and inadequate staff and resource
management contribute to delays, errors, and diminished patient experiences. One critical improvement
is displaying billing information directly on the Patients Tab, enabling patients to stay informed about
their expenses, reducing confusion, and fostering transparency. This not only enhances communication
but also builds trust between patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, hospitals often struggle to
engage patients with timely notifications for appointments, test results, and follow-ups, further
impacting care quality. The WellCare - Hospital Management System addresses these challenges by
offering a comprehensive platform to streamline scheduling, centralize patient data, and improve patient
engagement. By integrating modern technologies, it aims to enhance operational efficiency, optimize
resource utilization, and ultimately elevate the quality of patient care.
